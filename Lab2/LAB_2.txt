LAB 2
 

This lab you will continue your previous lab that contains the Post entity. You will be adding another entity with similar functionalities based on the following:

public class User {

    long id;
    String name;
    List<Post> posts;

}

1-	Make a domain model using the domain model above.
2-	Make a repository and database that will hold the Users. 
3-	Make a service layer that will inject the repository.
4-	Make an ORM relation between the User and Post entities, where a User holds a collection of Posts. Create it using uni-directional and JoinColumn
5-	Make a RestController for the User that will inject the service and respond to the following requests.

a.	GET	localhost:8080/users		 This should retrieve all the users in the database.
b.	GET	localhost:8080/users/1		 This should retrieve the user with id = 1.
c.	POST	localhost:8080/users		 This should create and save a new user. 
d.	GET	localhost:8080/users/1/posts	 This should retrieve the posts of the user where id = 1.

Note: 1 is just an example, the actual path should ask for ‘id’




Optional

6-	Make a query that will return all the users that have more than 1 post 

Make sure you execute all these requests using postman and follow best practices and conventions..
