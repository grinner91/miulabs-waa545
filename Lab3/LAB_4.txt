LAB 4
CS545 - AOP

This lab you will continue your previous lab that contains the User, Post, and Comments entities. You will be adding some cross-cutting concerns:



1-	Make a ‘Logger’ database table that will store all the operations executed in your project. The table should hold the following information (Transaction Id, Date, Time, Principle, Operation). 
  Since there is no authentication, you may define a fake static user for the principle and add it to every operation. This will be removed on the next lab. You may optionally add any suitable attribute.


2-	Make an Aspect that has an annotation pointcut @ExecutionTime, when placed on a method, it should calculate the time taken to complete that method. 
Add the annotation to the Get User By Id method in your project. 




Optional

3-	Make an ‘Exception’ database table that will track all the exceptions that were thrown (Transaction Id, Date, Time, Principle, Operation, Exception Type). 
Add a method that throws an exception to test it.


Make sure you execute all these requests using postman that follow best practices and conventions.
